Branch Behavior

1. If the current branch is a feature branch (i.e., NOT main):

   - Use the current branch as the PR branch.

2. If the current branch is main:
   - Create a new branch from main.
   - The new branch name should be automatically generated from the latest commit message, by converting the commit title into a branch-friendly slug.
   - Move all current unpushed commits onto this new branch.
   - Use this branch as the PR branch.

PR Handling
